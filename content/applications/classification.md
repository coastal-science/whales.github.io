## Classifying Whale Sounds With Deep Learning

Our team has developed sophisticated artificial intelligence models capable of identifying the sources of underwater sounds. As of now, our primary offering is a binary classifier designed specifically for detecting killer whales. This model operates by categorizing acoustic events into one of two groups: sounds produced by killer whales and sounds not produced by killer whales.

In the GIF below, you can see a model developed by one of our PhD students, Fabio Frazao. Each peak you observe represents a detection of SRKW vocalizations made by the model. Curious about how these vocalizations sound? Check out our [call catalogue](/applications/call-catalogue) with a curated set of recorded calls for a closer auditory experience.

All our current and future models are open-source and accessible via our public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coastal-science/HALLO-models). There you can find instructions, scripts, and configuration files required to train deep learning models at detecting and classifying vocalizations made by Killer whales. Each model comes with a detailed description, including the data used for training.

We are continuously working on developing more advanced models. These forthcoming models aim to classify whale vocalizations with a higher degree of specificity, such as distinguishing between different ecotypes or even identifying individual pods. Stay tuned for these exciting developments.
