Postdoctoral researcher, Peter Thompson, has been awarded the Liber Ero Postdoctoral Fellowship. This is awarded to early career scientists studying important and urgent conservation problems in Canada. Peter's research will analyze the movement and behaviour of endangered Southern Resident killer whales in the Salish Sea. Peter is interested in designing models that can predict what areas of the Salish Sea are most likely to be used by these whales, with a specific focus on interactions with marine vessels. His approach will integrate data collected through both visual and acoustic methods to maximize the available information about where the whales are go next. Congratulations Peter!
