    <h1>Open Positions</h1>
<p class="lead"> This NSERC CREATE program equips graduate students (Dalhousie, SFU, UVic) for careers in the booming field of underwater bioacoustics. As an "add-on" to your core degree, gain specialized, hands-on skills in A.I., data science, and software development. The program features industry internships and professional workshops, connecting your thesis research to real-world conservation and technology challenges. We acknowledge the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).</p>


    <h2>Eligibility</h2>


<p class="lead">Current or prospective graduate student at Dalhousie, SFU or UVic who are interested in marine sciences, who have identified a supervisor supporting your interest in research in this domaine. 
This program is hosted by three academic institutions, and is co-delivered by faculty at three coastal universities Dalhousie University, Simon Fraser University and University of Victoria, along with collaboration from leading collaborators working in this space.
Students will acquire highly specialized technical expertise and commercial skills in  machine learning, statistics, marine mammal science, bioacoustics, hardware and software through a combination of hands-on workshops, research projects, industrial internships and professional development workshops to ensure job readiness among graduates pursuing careers in the emerging field of underwater bioacoustics technologies and conservation sectors. Further information on the program can be found below.
This program is not a graduate program by itself. It is meant as “add on” training to a student’s degree program. Every student will have a home department and will take part in the WHALES CREATE Graduate Program in addition to their other studies.
